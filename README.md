<p>
Close the ticket. Once the issue has been resolved, you can close the ticket by marking it as "solved" or "closed" in the osTicket application. This will move the ticket to the closed ticket list, indicating that it has been resolved. You may also need to provide a brief summary or report on the resolution of the issue.
